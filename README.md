This is an implementation of a shopping cart with vanilla javascript

This simple project has the features to add a course to the shopping cart, if you select the same product more than one time the quantity is updated, also you can delete an item if you don't want it or you can delete the whole shopping cart content.

Also you can refresh the website and the items in the shopping cart will still be there, this is because the shopping cart items are saved to the local storage.
